# Project1_FYS4150

## In this project we have the following files:

- In Task2.hpp we have the analytical solution
- In Task7_1.hpp we have the numerical algorithm
- In Task9_1.hpp we have the special numerical algorithm
- Task8.cpp is our sourcefile where we use the functions from Task2.hpp and Task7_1.hpp and save the solutions to two separate files and
  find the absolute and relative error. OBS! When you change the n_steps parameter its important to also change the name of the output files. So as not to 
  overwrite the old one.
- In Task10.cpp we time the functions from Task7_1.hpp and Task9_1.hpp to see the difference between the numerical and the special numerical algorithm.
  
  
 ## Compiling and running
  
- To run the functions in Task2.hpp and Task7_1.cpp one has to compile and rund Task8.cpp. For the solutions to be written to files the parameter "file" 
  has to be equal to one. They can also be run by compiling and running Task.cpp.
- To obtain our solutions one has to change the parameter n_steps and make sure that all the solutions get written to file, also in the header files. For     Task8.cpp n_steps = 10, 100, 1000, 10000 and for Task10.cpp n_steps = 10^1,...,10^6
